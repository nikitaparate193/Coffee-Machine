<h1 align="center"> Coffee Machine Simulator ‚òï</h1>

A Coffee Machine Simulator is a digital tool that provides a virtual coffee-making experience, allowing users to practice, learn, or simply enjoy the process of brewing coffee without the need for physical coffee-making equipment. It can be both educational and entertaining for coffee lovers and those interested in honing their barista skills.


## **Features**

- **Buy Coffee:** Users can select from three different types of coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino), each with its price and ingredient requirements. The machine dispenses coffee if there are enough ingredients.

- **Espresso:** price - $4/cup, water needed ‚Äì 250 ml/cup, milk needed ‚Äì 0 ml/cup, beans needed - 16/cup

- **Latte:** price - $7/cup, water needed ‚Äì 350 ml/cup, milk needed ‚Äì 75 ml/cup, beans needed - 20/cup

- **Cappuccino:** price - $6/cup, water needed ‚Äì 200 ml/cup milk needed ‚Äì 100 ml/cup beans needed - 12/cup.

- **Add Ingredients:** The simulator allows users to refill the machine with water, milk, and coffee beans, ensuring a constant supply of ingredients.

- **Take Money:** The maintainer can easily withdraw the money collected from coffee sales, helping track earnings.

- **Show Ingredients:** Users can check the current levels of water, milk, coffee beans, and the amount of money in the machine.

- **Exit Option:** The simulation can be terminated gracefully when the user is done.

- **Data Analytics:** There's an analytics feature to display key statistics:

- **Intuitive REPL Interface:** The application features a user-friendly Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) console interface, making it easy for users to interact with the simulator.

## **OOPS Concepts Used**

In the Coffee Machine Simulator code provided, several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts have been utilized. Here are the OOP concepts used in the implementation:

**1.Classes and Objects:**

- The **`CoffeeMachine`** class represents the coffee machine and encapsulates its state and behavior.
- The **`Main`** class contains the main method and serves as the entry point of the program.

**2.Encapsulation:**

- The **`CoffeeMachine`** class encapsulates the internal state of the coffee machine, such as the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and money.
